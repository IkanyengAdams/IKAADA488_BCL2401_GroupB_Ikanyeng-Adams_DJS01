### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

The Mars Climate Orbiter incident in 1999 is a stark reminder of the importance of precision in space missions, highlighting how a simple unit mismatch led to the loss of the spacecraft. This challenge seeks to simulate similar challenges in a spacecraft navigation system, emphasising the need for accuracy in calculations.

#### Challenge Overview

This challenge invites students to debug, refactor, and enhance JavaScript functions designed for determining the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed and may result in incorrect calculations.


##### Problem Areas to Address

1. **Unit Mismatch**: The provided functions fail to convert units correctly, leading to calculation inaccuracies.
2. **Parameter Misalignment**: Parameters are not handled in a way that prevents or highlights the potential for unit mismatch errors, leading to possible confusion.
